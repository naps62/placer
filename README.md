# Placer

Automatically setup your apps and windows after startup

## Usage

Placer works by looking for windows matching the ones you specify on a config file. If they're not found, it will try to run the apropriate commands to open them.
It will also place each window at the desired desktops and coordinates

To call it just pass the config file as argument:

./placer config_file

## Configuration

Look at `sample_config` for an example
